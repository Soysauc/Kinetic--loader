# Kinetic Loader

This was a super short project that was again inspired by the 50 projects in 50 days.
It is an animated loader that uses Keyframes. Javascript wasnt needed for the outcome. Personally I don't know when I would use something like this but I'm happy to have extra practice with Keyframes.
